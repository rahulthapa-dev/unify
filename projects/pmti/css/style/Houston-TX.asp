                    We realize PMP training is a big investment. So, when students pick a PMP training course, you might want to ask several questions. It is not uncommon for students to select a less than average course provider for their PMP certification goals only to be disappointed by low quality, poor customer service, or unconducive venues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are things to watch out for when selecting a PMP training provider:

                <ul class="index-ul-style">
                    <li>
                        <p> Do they offer true 100% money-back guarantee or will they hold-off some portion of the fee? Before you sign-up for a course check if their terms indicate the fees are non-refundable or if they keep a portion of the fee you paid when they guarantee a course. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Check their cancellation terms. If they cancel a class, will they refund?</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Do they have non-refundable fee terms? Run the other way!</p>

                                    Does the pmp course meet or exceed the PMP exam outline as provided by PMI?

                                    Is the PMP course agenda established and set by experts in project management and experienced PMP instructors?

                                    Does the pmp course include not just addressing the targeted PMP exam knowledge and skills but also educate you on the PMP exam strategy and provide valuable and actionable tips, tricks, and guidance?

                                    How long has the company implemented the course and the four-day PMP class curriculum? The longer they have successfully done it, the better. (Project Management Training Institute has been at it since 2003! Our schedule was developed as a result of several designed experiments to find the optimal model with 4-days. We are flattered that several other companies have since imitated our model.

                                    Does the course include adequate mock exams to reinforce knowledge through repetition? Does it overdo testing to the point where there is no proper knowledge transfer?

                        <p>1. C - Actions such as adopting less complex processes, more testing, or choosing a more stable supplier would be considered as mitigation risk strategies. These actions reduce the probability and/or impact of risks.</p>
                        <p>2. C - A is not correct because a workaround is an unplanned response to an unknown risk that has occurred. In this situation, the risk has not occurred; it is only rumored to possibly occur. The correct response is C because the process of “Identify Risks” is an iterative process that happens throughout the life of the project. Because the risk is now identified, the risk register is updated with the risk and its contingency and fallback plans. Answer D is not an ethical course of action.</p>
                        <p>3. C - Benchmarking is a technique for planning quality.</p>
                        <p>4. A - A constraint is factor that limits a project’s options.</p>
                        <p>5. D - Rolling Wave Planning as a form of progressive elaboration planning where the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail at a low level of the work breakdown structure, while the work far in the future is planned at a relatively high level of the work breakdown structure, but the detailed planning of the work to be performed within another one or two periods in the near future is done as the work is being completed during the current period.</p>
                        <p>6. A - (A) Senior Management is most likely to have the financial authority appropriate to funding a very large project. Stakeholders (C) is too general a category. Customers (B) are the end users of the product and, although involving the customer in the charter definition often helps increase their commitment to the project, they are most likely to be involved in Collect Requirements, (D) Functional managers help staff large projects or may sponsor small, tactical projects.</p>
                        <p>7. C - Stakeholder Management Strategy is an output of (C) Identify Stakeholders. It is an input to A and B. Stakeholder analysis is a tool and technique used during Identify Stakeholders</p>
                        <p>8. A - The team is measuring power and influence. Stakeholders in the upper right quadrant of the grid rank higher than stakeholders in the other 3 quadrants.</p>
                        <p>9. C - Mandatory milestones are specified in the charter and must be met during the project.</p>
                        <p>10. A - Although obtaining signatures from B, C and D is often politically correct, the signature of the sponsor at a level appropriate to funding the project (A) is authorization for the project.</p>
                        <p>11. A - Delphi technique is an information gathering technique in which the team obtains information from a selected group of experts who have managed similar projects to help identify high-level risks. 5-why method is a tool to identify the root cause of a risk and is more commonly used in the planning process group where more detail is known about the project. Risk data quality assessment is used in qualitative risk analysis. Scatter diagrams show relationships and are a quality control tool.</p>
                        <p>12. C - A is incorrect because the WBS dictionary does not include the name of the sponsor. Test specifications (B) are not part of the WBS. The WBS dictionary contains all of the detail information about each deliverable in the WBS (C). The question does not suggest changes have occurred (D)</p>
                        <p>13. D - A is the technique of rolling costs estimated at a detail level up through the WBS to ensure all deliverables are considered. B applies to risk management. C is a false term D is the technique of ensuring that planned expenditures are within funding limits.</p>
                        <p>14. B - A uses float to help manage start and end dates for project activities. B inserts buffers to account for the uncertainty in the duration of the tasks and allows flexible start/end dates not to exceed the remaining buffer. C and D do not exist.</p>
                        <p>15. B - Definition</p>
                        <p>16. C - You are in completing your configuration management plan in Develop Project Management Plan. The configuration management system (CMS) is a subset of the PMIS and the change control plan is a subset of the CMS. The quality audit is a tool and technique used in Preform Quality Assurance.</p>
                        <p>17. A - A is a true statement; these change requests do not impact baselines, only actions. B, C and D are incorrect. Defects occur in processes as well as products, thus, repair requests are also an output of Perform Quality Assurance. Defect repairs are also generated as a result of process analysis or quality audits. Corrective and preventive actions may be requested by anyone and are outputs of planning and executing processes as well as monitoring and controlling.</p>
                        <p>18. D - A, B and C are included in the risk register. The risk management plan contains D as well as the methodology, budget, roles and responsibilities, a probability and impact matrix and other information regarding our approach to managing risk.</p>
                        <p>19. A - Following a qualitative risk analysis, updates to the risk register include a list of risks requiring response in the near term (A). B, C and D are unlikely to be an immediate issue.</p>
                        <p>20. C - A plan (A, D) describes how activities will be managed. The assumptions log lists factors believed to be true for planning purposes. The risk register identifies all risks, including causes, probability, impact, proposed responses, owners and current status.</p>
                        <p>21. D - Root cause analysis is used to identify risks, not analyze them. A and B use optimistic and pessimistic as well as most likely estimates to determine possible outcomes. C predicts the outcome of a decision if a situation turns out to be greater or less than the original estimate.</p>
                        <p>22. A - A common active acceptance strategy is to establish reserves of time, money and resources to handle the risks if one of them should occur. The watch list is part of the risk register. C is an activity in Monitor and Control Risks. D is likely to happen during execution of the project and also be a part of Monitor and Control Risk.</p>
                        <p>23. D - Plan Procurements and Conduct Procurements processes are generally concurrent with all project management planning (A). All stakeholders do not have assignments on a project (B). The charter is usually not updated (C). Changes to scope, schedule or cost baselines due to progressive elaboration are approved by the sponsor (or a CCB) and are usually presented to the signers of the charter before continuing with the project.</p>
                        <p>24. B - A is an OPA. B is the document; C is the tool and technique used to reach the decision. D identifies resources by category.</p>
                        <p>25. C - A cost plus contract presumes you have not developed a detailed scope baseline, so A is not a good answer. B is slightly better since you are considering a solution as well as price. However, on major procurement items, the overall process of requesting and evaluating responses from sellers can be repeated, so C is the best answer to get the best possible solution before signing the contract. There is nothing in the question to imply that an incentive is required.</p>
                        <p>26. C - Quality assurance uses all quality-related tools. The process analysis is the method used to determine why processes are not going according to plan. The cause and effect diagram is the tool the team would use to conduct the root cause analysis within the process analysis.</p>
                        <p>27. C - A does not exist. In B, the risk owner recognizes the symptoms. In C, the team carries out the activities in the plan. D is the responsibility of the project manager.</p>
                        <p>28. C - A is used to test conformance to standards. B is a business management strategy promoting quality. C is the study and analysis of historical information to predict future outcomes. D is a histogram used to identify causes of an error. All of these can be used in quality assurance.</p>
                        <p>29. B - You may call to soften the blow but status on slippage should be formal and documented.</p>
                        <p>30. B - Bottom-Up Estimating is a method of estimating a component of work. The cost of individual activities is estimated with the greatest level of specified detail. The detailed cost is then summarized or “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes.</p>
                        <p>31. B - Lump Sum contract is also referred to as a “Fixed Price” or “Firm Fixed Price” contract.</p>
                        <p>32. D - As part of data representation, a tool and technique for the process, Plan Stakeholder Engagement, the project management team uses a SEAM – Stakeholders Engagement Assessment Matrix to document the current and desired stakeholder engagement levels as – unaware (of impacts), resistant (to change), neural, supportive and leading. A stakeholder engagement assessment matrix supports comparison between the current engagement levels of stakeholders and the desired engagement levels required for successful project delivery.</p>
                        <p>33. D - Fast tracking is doing activities in parallel to reduce the duration of the project, not the activity. Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration. An example is constructing the foundation for a building before completing all of the architectural drawings. Be sure to read the question and all answers carefully, the word activity makes answer A incorrect. If you are torn between 2 answers, reread the question.</p>
                        <p>34. C - The economic value of the next best alternative foregone when a given alternative has been selected is called opportunity cost. Sunk cost is money spent in a project that did not return any benefit. ACWP or Actual Cost is another term for money spent thus far in the project. Lost cause is not a project management term.</p>
                        <p>35. D - Project manager competencies include technical, leadership, and strategic / business skills.</p>
                        <p>36. C - The project management team must identify the project stakeholders, determine their requirements, interest, and expectations, and manage their influence as much as possible in relation to those requirements to ensure a successful project. Options A, B & D are not root causes of the problem. The main issue is not identifying the stakeholders and the resulting unidentified requirements. D is too broad a statement. Nothing in the question indicates a charter was not approved. More alarming in answer D is “other PM processes were not followed” without qualifying which ones. So, D is less correct answer.</p>
                        <p>37. A - The requirements traceability matrix is a document generated in collect requirements. It provides the means to trace requirements from requirements origin to testing. This document links requirements to the project goals, origin, deliverables, WBS, product design, and test scenarios. The control scope process then manages any changes to the product scope to see this objective is achieved.</p>
                        <p>38. C - There are some risks that you cannot avoid or mitigate. When this situation occurs all, you can do is accept the risk and inform key stakeholders about their potential. The accept strategy indicates that the project team has decided not to change the project management plan to deal with a risk or is unable to identify any other suitable response strategy.</p>
                        <p>39. B - A, risk audits and risk assessments are conducted in Monitor Risks. Plan Resource Management addresses answer C. D is a function of Manage Team. As project team development efforts such as training, team building, and co-location are implemented, the project management team makes formal or informal assessments of the project team’s effectiveness. These Team Performance Assessments which are an output of Develop Team may include indicators such as desired and expected improvements in individual skills and increased team cohesiveness.</p>
                        <p>40. D - Stakeholder cube is a refinement of the grid models previously mentioned. This model combines the stakeholder grid elements (power, influence, impact, etc.) into a three-dimensional model that can be useful to project managers and teams in identifying and engaging their stakeholder community. It provides a model with multiple dimensions that improves the depiction of the stakeholder community as a multidimensional entity and assists with the development of communication strategies.</p>
                        <p>41. B - The lessons learned register is created as an output of this process early in the project. It is updated in all other processes. The lessons learned register can include the category and description of the situation. The lessons learned register may also include the impact, recommendations, and proposed actions associated with the situation. The lessons learned register may record challenges, problems, realized risks and opportunities, or other content as appropriate.</p>
                        <p>42. C - “Quality Audits” is a tool and technique of Manage Quality. Verifying changes & deliverables is not a part of a quality audit but is an output of Control Quality. Any changed or repaired items are inspected and will be either accepted or rejected before notification of the decision is provided. Objectives of a quality audit are to identify good/best practices being implemented, identify gaps/shortcomings and identify ineffective and inefficient processes. It also adds to the lesson learned database, and confirms implementation of approved change requests, corrective actions, defect repairs, and preventive actions.</p>
                        <p>43. A - On-demand scheduling - This approach, typically used in a Kanban system, is based on the theory-of-constraints and pull-based scheduling concepts from lean manufacturing to limit a team’s work in progress in order to balance demand against the team’s delivery throughput. On-demand scheduling does not rely on a schedule that was developed previously for the development of the product or product increments, but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue of work to be done immediately as resources become available. On-demand scheduling is often used for projects that evolve the product incrementally in operational or sustainment environments, and where tasks may be made relatively similar in size and scope or can be bundled by size and scope.</p>
                        <p>44. C - A constraint is a limiting factor such as a limited budget or an imposed deadline. Dependency attributes include internal or external; mandatory or discretionary. This dependency is mandatory. The word “only” should alert you to this. The only answer with mandatory is C.</p>
                        <p>45. A - O = 2, M = 4, P = 6 (3 times optimistic). Calculate PERT estimate using the formula (O+4M+P)/6 = (2+16+6)/6 = 4 weeks.</p>
                        <p>46. D - Applying the Risk Score equation for each of the projects, we get:
                            RS (Delay) = 3 x (3+5+2+0) = 30
                            RS (Vendors) = 2 x (2+3+0+4) = 18
                            RS (Bugs) = 5 x (0+2+2+4) = 40
                            RS (Interfaces) = 1 x (4+0+2+3) = 9
                            So, the risk of “Unknown Bugs” has the greatest impact on the project
                        </p>
                        <p>47. B - Change requests occur only after there are baselines and after the entire project management is baselined. Since work gets done during the executing phases and is tracked, orchestrated, and reviewed in monitoring and controlling processes, change requests, corrective actions, preventive actions, and defect repairs - all of which are now called change requests - occur predominantly during these two process groups, primarily in M & C processes.</p>
                        <p>48. B - This is the definition of the critical path. While adding 0 days of free float is not part of the definition, all activities on the critical path have 0 days of free float because they cannot be delayed without delaying a successor activity. Answer D might be something to consider for a specific situation, such as a resource availability problem, as the purpose of an activity buffer is to protect the project from an identified risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>49. B - Negative EMV represents a threat and positive EMV represents an opportunity</p>
                        <p>50. C - The question is listing the inputs and tools and techniques of Monitor Risks process. The output is risk register updates. The risk register is updated with information on individual project risks generated during the Monitor Risks process. This may include adding new risks, updating outdated risks or risks that were realized, updating risk responses, and so forth.</p>

                        <h3>PMP Certification News</h3>
                        <p><strong>August 31, 2020</strong></p>
                        <p>PMI announces four new Disciplined Agile certifications:</p>
                        <p>PMI announces the following certifications:</p>
                        <p>Disciplined Agile Scrum Master </p>
                        <p>Disciplined Agile Senior Scrum Master </p>
                        <p>Disciplined Agile Coach</p>
                        <p>Disciplined Agile Value Stream Consultant</p>
                        <p>This is in addition to the already popular PMI Agile Certified Practitioner certification. </p>
                        <p>Project Management Training Institute will be offering training for all the above certifications as part of our PMI Authorized Training Partner (ATP) program. </p>
                        <p><strong>July 01, 2020</strong></p>
                        <p>PMTI instructors are now trained and certified by PMI as PMI Authorized Training Partner instructors fro providing the highest quality of training for PMP certification, CAPM certification, PMI-ACP certification, and Disciplined Agile. PMTI hires experts in project management who have stayed abreast with the latest and greatest in training philosophies. With this certification from PMI, PMTI instructors will incorporate ways in which modern learners engage in classroom and online as well as combine multiple learning modes into our class.</p>
                        <p><strong>June 20, 2020</strong></p>
                        <p>PMI no longer requires the 4500 hours of project management experience for PMP certification. The new PMP certification application that PMI launched does not have a section to document the hours worked in a documented project. PMI will now check if you met the PMP certification requirements in terms of a) primary education and b) number of overlapping months you have worked.</p>
                        <p><strong>June 15, 2020</strong></p>
                        <p>PMI launches a new improved application for PMP certification! The same simpler application will also be now used for CAPM, PgMP, and PfMP certifications. The new application is easier to use and faster to complete.</p>
                        <p><strong>May 30, 2020</strong></p>
                        <p>Following PMI’s new format of breaking the test into two sections and the OPT option of testing at home or office, a lot of new information is being reported by our students related to the Online Proctored Test (OPT) option of testing for the PMP exam. Here are some highlights.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You need to present a clean desk with pictures uploaded using your phone or show with your camera on the laptop.</li>
                            <li>The test is no longer one single run of 200 questions. It is divided into two parts. The first part contains 90 questions. Whenever the PMP exam taker completes this section, review answers and submits it they are allowed to take a 10-minute break. It is important to return before the break expires. Any delays will result in the automatic submission of the complete test.</li>
                            <li>Exam takers need to be on camera through the entire period of testing</li>
                            <li>No scratch sheets are allowed. An online whiteboard functionality is provided.</li>
                        </ul>

                                    When you’re preparing for the PMP certification exam, a long-term prep is basically suicide.

In PMTI, we have a 99% overall pass rate that has stayed consistent for almost 20 years. So we can definitely help you pass your PMP certification exam, and we’ll back that claim by giving you a 100% money-back guarantee.
