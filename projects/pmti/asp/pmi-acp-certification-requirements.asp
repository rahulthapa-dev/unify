                                <p>Between 2010 and 2020 an estimated 15.7 million new project management jobs will be added globally... reaching an economic impact of over $18 trillion, across seven project-intensive industries. In the United States, the demand for project management professionals will grow by nearly 700,000 jobs.

                                <b>Tip:</b> It is incredibly important that you do not falsify any of the information in your application. PMI has a random audit process which requires anyone being audited to present evidence to validate all information submitted with their application. Falsifying application documentation will result banishment from all future attempts to obtain any PMI certification.

                            <p>
                                In order to maintain the integrity of the PMI-ACP certification and enhance the credibility of PMI-ACP credential holders, PMI routinely conducts random audits of a certain percentage the PMI-ACP exam applications. Although PMI does not publish what percentage gets audited, our 14 years of experience shows about one in four or five of the applications get audited.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h4 class="fw-600">How Will I Know If I'm Being Audited?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Generally, you will not know you are audited until your application has been accepted and you have been authorized to pay. Once you complete the payment, you will be informed if you have been selected as an audit candidate within a few minutes via email or the online application portal. If you receive an email with an approval code or receive an approval code within your PMI application portal then you have not been audited and can schedule your PMI-ACP exam at your convenience.

                                While the auditing process may appear intimidating just from the phrase, it is not as long as you follow the steps outlined by PMI. As part of our application prep tool assistance process we provide several tips that will simplify this process and will make it easy for you to navigate.

                                            This refers to the 21 contact hours of training you have included in your PMI-ACP exam application. Most companies will provide a certificate and a copy of this certificate should suffice. If you did not receive a certificate as part of the training, a letter from a manager and/or training group indicating the <strong>DETAILS</strong> of the training will be required. Please ensure it states the number of hours you spent in training. The training must be in areas related to Agile project management.
