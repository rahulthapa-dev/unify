Keep in mind that this is a Boot Camp, so there is an enormous amount of content to consume during the scheduled class hours - and there was homework each evening. The instructor I had (John S.) was excellent. He was able to deliver the course content in a concise and measured manner that was easy to digest. I shopped around for the best value and found that the PMTI Boot Camp was the most comprehensive training offering for my dollar. In addition to the Boot Camp classroom instruction, you are provided with access to tools that help you with properly submitting the PMP exam application, along with online videos of the daily class content and online access to multiple practice tests – all of which can be viewed before and after the Boot Camp. The classroom learning, coupled with the online videos and tests, was the perfect combination of information that helped me pass the PMP exam on the first attempt. ”"</p></div>
