                            <p>Many veterans have project management experience—just under a different name. The challenge is in the translation and repackaging of their skill sets so that hiring managers spot their skills. Mission-related often translates to ‘projectized,’ and the government and military are highly projectized environments, which make many veterans a natural fit for the project management world.</p>

                            As PMI President and CEO, Mark Langley states, military experience translates exceptionally well into the field of project management. So well that Langley describes the relationship in a way that seems symbiotic. Military experience and project management in the civilian world may not use identical vernacular, but the methodologies are the same. This means that your military experience and skillset is extremely valuable to a career in project management.
