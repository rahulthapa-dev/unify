                                It generally takes PMI 5-7 business days to review & respond to your application. But if you’re selected for an audit, PMI will wait until they receive your completed audit documents to verify their accuracy & completeness before they approve your application. So, plan accordingly.

                            </p>

                            <p>

                                <strong>Important:</strong> A very small percentage of applications will be subject to a <a href="http://4pmti.com/pmp-audit-process" target="_blank" class="theme-text">random audit process</a> that’ll require anyone being audited to present evidence to validate all of the information they submitted with their application. 

                            </p>

                            <p>

                                Failing the audit process or submitting an incomplete or inaccurate PMP application could result in resubmitting your application and further delays.
