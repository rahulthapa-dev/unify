Excellent work delivered by Sachin! I am glad that I got the opportunity to work with him. His communication was top-notch, he met all deadlines, and his skills were reasonably strong. At one point I asked for an additional milestone and he accepted it and finished it smoothly. He gave proper time to this project, he solved all of my doubts and provide detailed comments. I enjoyed working with Sachin and will likely have additional jobs for him in the future.
